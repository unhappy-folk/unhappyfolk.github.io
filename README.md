### `Un-Happy Folk` 
"None of you should long for death because of a calamity that had befallen him, and if he cannot, but long for death, then he should say, 'O Allah! Let me live as long as life is better for me, and take my life if death is better for me.'" 
– *Prophet Muhammad, Peace be upon Him.* 

 “Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will ˹all˺ return.” 
 – *Chapter 2 (The Cow), 156*

  “Such there is Night – Not Night as ours, Unhappy Folk” 
  –*J.R.R. Tolkien*
